# Keymos and Gmos
Here ,we have developed two softwares:
1.Keymos
2.Gmos


1.)Keymos-Keymos is an innovate and free software which will enable its user to control mouse and keyboard using the
android app.The android app has an area which will act as a touchpad similar too what is available on laptop.Mouse can be
controlled by moving your finger on the touchpad area of Keymos on your mobile screens.It has buttons for right click,double click,
right click.copy and pasteThere is a button called drag.When drag button is on ,it will enable user to drag and select texts 
and windows.In addition to this,when you type something on the Edittext area of the Keymos,same will be displayed on the pc/laptop 
where cursor is placed.
  Keymos is the set of two softwares i.e an executable file which run on pc and other is an android app 
run on android phone.The executable file name servercopy has to run on the laptop/pc which will act as a server.The android app i.e 
Keymos has to installed on android phone whose apk is also provided in the repository.
  Keymos is aimed to laptops and pc free from conventional mouse and keyboard by enabling user to control pc function using their 
  mobile phones.This is future of loptop and pc control.
  
  
  2.)Gmos - G-gesture and mos-mouse i.e. gesture controled mouse. All task performed by mouse is mapped to the different gesture of hand.
  Gesture is shown by position of finger. Three fingers are assigned three different color(color used are blue, red, yellow). At start It will ask you to calibrate color on trackbar. Yellow color finger decide free movement of mouse at that time other two finger should be shown to camera and they both will be static. For Right click , we have to just attach two color (blue and red). For left click , we have to attach yellow and blue color together.
  for reference watch video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20V4P30iObk&t=12s
 Everytime we have to calibrate color which take time . hence we have made algorithm which will give HSV value for specific color without calibration. It is based on region of interest. Crop it then convert it into hsv then calculate mode (maximum pixels having same HSV value). which will be hsv value.
